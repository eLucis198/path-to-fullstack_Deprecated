# Path To FullStack

Here I will be committing my personal repo used to learn multiple technologies, all related to NodeJS.

## Why is this README.md so long?

I created this README.md for learning. It centralizes everything that is code related but it's not code. I found out that putting everything here is the best way I can teach myself. Putting the file in the spotlight is cool too.

## Introduction

I'll be dividing this README in four different categories.

1. **DONE -** Technologies that I've somewhat learned and that I'm already using.
2. **DOING -** Technologies that I'm learning right now or will learn in the near future.
3. **TODO -** Technologies that I'm not going to study in the near future but are on my radar.
4. **Extensions** VSCode Estensions.

# EXTENSIONS

## EditorConfig

> This plugin attempts to override user/workspace settings with settings found in .editorconfig files.

You can save your editor configurations in a `.editorconfig` file at the root folder.

# DONE

## NodeJS

> [Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

NodeJS is your runtime, npm your package manager.
Follow through the [installation](https://nodejs.org/en/) and both will be installed and ready to use.

### Using NodeJS and npm

`npm init` - Creates a package.json file.

`npm install` - Adds dependencies to the package.json file and install them at the node_modules folder.

`node index.js` - Runs the index.js file in NodeJS.

`package.json` is your project configuration file, edit the `scripts` part and create customizable Node commands.

## Yarn

> Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager. Whether you work on one-shot projects or large monorepos, as a hobbyist or an enterprise user, we've got you covered.

Well, I just think Yarn is easier to use.

`npm install -g yarn` - Install Yarn globally.

If you ever use npm in your repo you can delete the package-lock.json file and run `yarn`.

## Git and GitHub

> [Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.](https://git-scm.com/)

Git and GitHub are used to keep your code safe by allowing you to create multiple versions of your repo and backing it up to the cloud.

### Setup

* [Git can be downloaded here.](https://git-scm.com/download)
* [GitHub home page can be accessed here.](https://github.com/)

### Using Git

`.gitignore` is a file that you can create in the root folder of your project that tells Git the files that should be ignored

`git init` - Initializes a git repository locally.

`git add .` - Stores snapshot temporary in the index.

`git commit` - Permanently stores index contents.

`git log` - Logs commits.

`git branch feature/name` - Creates a branch named **feature/name**.

`git checkout feature/name` - Switchs to hte branch named **feature/name**.

`git merge feature/name` - Merges the branch named **featue/name** to the master.

`git branch -D feature/name` - Deletes the branch named **featue/name**.

`git remote add origin https://github.com/eLucis198/path-to-fullstack.git` - Syncs to your GitHub repo.

`git push -u origin master` - Pushes master branch to GitHub.

`git pull origin master` - Pulls from GitHub to the master branch .

## Express

> Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Best thing ever for HTTP requests and routing.

`yarn add express` - Installs the express dependency.

## TypeScript

>TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

This may be the best thing I found out here haha, makes your code much more clear, looks like OOP :laughing:

### Setting up

`yarn global add typescript` - Installs typescript globally in your machine.
`yarn add typescript --d` - Installs typescript as a development dependency.

### Transpile - sucrase + nodemon

`yarn add sucrase nodemon -D` - Installs sucrase and nodemon as a dev dependencies.

Create a nodemon.json file for configurations.
```json
{
  "watch": ["src"],
  "ext": "ts",
  "execMap": {
    "ts:": "sucrase-node src/server.ts"
  }
}
```
Alter package.json
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/server.ts",
  "build": "sucrase ./src -d ./dist --transforms typescript,imports"
},
```
`yarn dev` - Runs app.
`yarn buid` - Builds app.

### Transpile - ts-node-dev

Run `yarn tsc --init` to init a tsconfig.json file. (Only works with typescript installed globally)

Add this line to the tsconfig.json file
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "outDir": "./dist/"
    }
}
```

You can transpile your code just by running `yarn tsc` and the files should be in the dist directory.

For automated transpiles I'll use __ts-node-dev__.
Install it by running `yarn add ts-node-dev --d`.

Add this line to your packge.json file.
```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev:server": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpileOnly src/index.ts"
  },
```
Now run `yarn dev:server`. Your project is running it transpiles automatically at every code update.

### Types

You need to install the "types" of your dependencies for the IntelliSense to work.

`npm install @types/express -D` - Install the types of express as a development dependency.

## ESLint

> A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Maintain your code quality with ease.

Points out error in TS code.

### Setup

Install the extension ESLint.

Run `yarn add -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` to install.

To initialize run `yarn eslint --init` and configure it. (Now you can delete package-lock.json and run `yarn`)

Add line to .eslintrc.js
```js
extends: [
  'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
  'standard'
],
```

Now open your vsCode preferences {{ Ctrl - Shift + P  ==>>  preferences: open settings (json) }}

Add the following lines
```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
},
"eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "typescript",
    "typescriptreact"
]
```
All done, now TypeScript is running with ESLint :ok_hand:

## Prettier

> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

### Setup

Run `yarn add prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier -D`.

Add line to .eslintrc.js
```js
extends: [
  'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
  'prettier/@typescript-eslint',
  'standard'
],
```
